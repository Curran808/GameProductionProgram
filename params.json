  "body": "### Solo-Play mode\r\nPrivate lessons would be a 3 hour window in which students would come to MIC with a project which they would like to work on. Students would work directly with a developer to build the project. The developer would break down the project into 3 hour sessions, and create a timeline of when the project can be expected to finish. The lessons will be very student driven in which the students would be introduced as a part of either a Creative Track or Gaming Track. Basically the track just adds a theme to get the student started on a project.\r\n\r\n### Game Developer | Game Track\r\nCurrently gaming is the most popular form of entertainment. This course will cover many of the basic lessons of how many of these games are made and more importantly how to make our own game. Many of the “simple” mobile games that we see today are replicable. We are always seeing “clones” of the same set of games, but for some reason only one or two become very popular. We will dive into what exactly is it that makes that game popular and how to build our own game.\r\n\r\n### Game Music Composer | Creative Track\r\nPress start! \r\n[bing!]\r\nYou are to collaborate with the Game Developer to create a mini sound library and a theme song for a game. Learn to organize, work as a team and communicate your artistic vision and bring out the best in the interactivity. The learning process will hone in your creative intuition to drive the making of your own song that fits the game criteria with Sonic-PI. We will be playing a lot of music. Listening is critical especially when it comes down to rhythm, tempo and tones. You will bring a collection of 20 game music midis. We will take a look at your selections of songs and identify structures for melodic and rhythmic motives that drives a story. There will be short exercises of music theory and song arrangements in the GarageBand to help create the composition of an original song for the project. At the end, you will present your final piece in the game. \r\n[continue?]\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
